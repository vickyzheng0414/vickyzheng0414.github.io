            Context/Content
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about applying what I have learned in the course to my own creations and creating a website about how my topic relates to technology. The purpose of this website I made is to make connections between technology and art design by thoroughly explaining how different software and hardware have been impacting this topic. For my project, I am making a website about art design using HTML, CSS, and Github. This entry will walk through my process of independently studying technologies being used in the field of art and making the website. </p>
            Challenges
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I have faced throughout this year long project is brainstorming some ideas for my future innovations. Since there are already many advanced technologies that have been beneficial in the field of art design and most of ideas have already existed, I couldn't brainstorm any other ideas. Someday, I realized that I can combine some of the most efficiently and effectly used softwares and hardwares into one whole idea. Therefore, the outcome of my future innovation is using pen displays (hardware) and create an app (software) where it allows us to draw and you can choose whether you would want 2D or 3D drawings. This will be beneficial for any types of artists, where it aims for manga & comic, filming & animation, 3D models, etc.</p>
            Takeaways
            <p>My biggest takeaway from this freedom project was communication. Communication was a huge part where I had to articulate ideas to my classmates and public speaking in presentations. Another takeaway was presenting my website in front of others and asking for feedback and tips on where and how I can improve. I learned that seeing things from different perspectives would be a very helpful strategy, especially when it comes to making a website and presenting it in front of others. My next step is to fix my accordion for mobile users so that the text doesn't float to the side of the page.</p>

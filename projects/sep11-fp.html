            Context/Content
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about using knowledge from Javascript units and making something functional, creating an interactive program using Javascript library, frameworks, etc. The purpose of this is to summarize the purpose of Freedom Project and go through the process of making the project. Students also include their challenges, how they overcome them, and what skills have they improved on throughout each process.</p>
            Challenges
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I have faced throughout this year long project is brainstorming some ideas of what types of games I should make. I came up with many ideas but ended up making a game where the player would has to collect the key and entering the next level by successfully avoid all the enemies. Another challenge was that when I was trying to add multiple objects onto the screen, some objects would appear outside of the screen. I then realized that to solve this issue, I had to use scene and added blocks to serve as a border so that all objects are being placed in the scene. While making the scene and levels, I have faced some obstacles as well. Because bracket notations we use in Kaboom are different than what we use in Javascript, I have had many errors where I either am missing a bracket somewhere or I placed the wrong bracket notation. Due to the fact that I had a bunch of lines of code written down already, it was very difficult to find where the missing or extra bracket was. Therefore, I made a new file and re-coded my game, but this time checking for brackets very carefully and sepcifically so that I don't make the mistake again. </p>
            Takeaways
            <p>I had many takeaways from the expo elevator pitch and the in-class presentations. One takeaway I had from the expo was that many students have suggested us to either adding more levels to our game or increasing the difficulty by adding a movement for our enemy sprite. Another takeaway was to add a prize section at the end based on the amount of coins the player collected because that would've been more interesting where everyone would want to see the prize. An overall takeaway from writing the code for this game was that reading documentations and watching videos can be very helpful because it can help you break down parts into smaller pieces. Also, double checking your code specifically can save you lots of time especially when you have written hundreds of code and need to go back to check where your mistakes are.</p>
